# Machine_learning

- Building and evaluating several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data from peer-to-peer lending services. 
- Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification so different techniques for training and evaluating models will be used with imbalanced classes. You will use
- The imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries will be use to build and evaluate models by the two following technique such as Resampling and Ensemble Learning


# Resampling
- For the imbalanced learn library to resample the LendingClub data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled
